## JS Project Proposal: Agario Clone (Name TBD)

Based on the popular Agar.io, the game where circle blobs consume other circle blobs in their attempts to either stay alive, or dominate the circle stratosphere.

### Functionality and MVP

The game works by having a player controlling a small circle, and eats other circles to gain mass and grow bigger. Beware of bigger circles trying to eat you.

MVP Features should include a scoring system, menu options, one and two players. A production readme will be available.

### Wireframes


### Architecture and Technologies

- Javascript
- HTML5 Canvas

Game should have a 2D layout (rectangular) with boundaries and random NPC circles should spawn randomly to maintain a playable board state. As the player gets bigger, there should be bigger circles that can consume the player to ensure a sense of urgency and survival.

As it stands, there should be the following components:
- Circle
- Moving Object
- Board/Grid
- Game Logic

### Implementation Guideline

Day 1: Learn all the necessary tools and resources to begin starting on the game (HTML Canvas, any other novel JS ideas that may be helpful in the creation of the game)

Day 2: Continue to add necessary API to make the game playable, begin to round out the program in a shape of a game, hopefully make it playable.

Day 3-5: Playable game, add features such as scoring, two player, and perhaps bonus abilities such as spitting out yourself to make you smaller and faster.

BONUS Features: Multiplayer using sockets.
