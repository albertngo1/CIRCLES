### Background
CIRCLES is a game of circles where the goal is to eat as many circles smaller than you while not getting eaten yourself. Get a high score and have your name etched in history. The game draws inspiration from the popular massively-multiplayer online game Agar.io.

To get started, enter your name (if desired) and click play. Use `W` `A` `S` `D` keys to move around directionally and your circle (etched with your name on it) will start at the center of the screen.
